      "Three gates stand before the seeker: one of memory, one of pattern, one of possibility. The first shows what was, the second what is, the third what might be. Only by passing through all three in the correct sequence will the Oracle reveal its secrets. Which gate must you enter first?",
      "In the Coral Forest grows a tree with seven branches, each bearing fruit of a different color. The red grants strength but blinds wisdom, the blue opens minds but weakens resolve, the green connects hearts but isolates thoughts. Which fruit would you choose to navigate the Machine Archipelago?",
      "I am the currency that cannot be spent, the knowledge that cannot be taught, the power that grows when given away. The Iron Citadel guards me, the Sunken Library catalogs me, but only the Veiled Spring truly understands my nature. What am I?",
      "Five symbols carved in quantum stone, each holding part of Atlantis' truth. The first is a circle unbroken, the second a wave frozen in time, the third a bridge between worlds, the fourth a key without a lock, the fifth a mirror facing inward. Arrange them correctly and the path forward reveals itself."
